# About
One stop shop to create sia paper wallet.

# Purpose

Allow users to create and store their siacoin on a paper wallet.

# Contribution

We have some what clear roadmap of where we would like things to progress
if you have suggests and improvements we are open to hearing them and
collaborating.

Some low hanging fruit for new contributors:

- Nice printable wallet designs for use are conferences and the like.
- Creating a builds to distribute local binaries for Windows, Linux, macOS.
- Get it listed on other paper wallet sites. (no programming needed)

# Usage

Simply go to the site and generate a new wallet. Keep it private. Print it off.
Please be sure to do so – once you leave its gone forever. I would also test a
small amount before you do so, because you know we are human and mistakes happen.

Peace and Prosper. Special Thanks to sia.tech team!
